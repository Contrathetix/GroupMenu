# GroupMenu

Experimental add-on for The Elder Scrolls Online to allow more information about the current group members to be shown in the group menu of the in-game user interface. The add-on adds the new user interface controls inside the existing elements, to avoid unnecessary creation of clutter.

Requires the following libraries:

* LibAddonMenu-2.0

Please note that the add-on is unusable at the moment!
